                    Not only my life but my whole family's life has changed. 
                    It was as if we were enchanted with a magic stick. What happened? I was fired. 
                    I was arrested. Everything I have earned has been taken away from me. 
                    Finally, I and my whole family were forced to leave our country. 
                    <br>
                    Was what I experienced after that night good or bad for me and my family? 
                    I do not know the answer to this question. But time will tell us the answer
